This is the source code of our IBDVM paper. The solver is a version of our open-source code [KitAMR.jl](https://github.com/CFDML/KitAMR.jl/tree/ge). The code is developed with Julia language. To implement the code, you may refer to the README in [KitAMR.jl](https://github.com/CFDML/KitAMR.jl/tree/ge). All the numerical experiments in the paper can be reproduced with the script in `/example`, with the terminal command `mpiexec -n NP julia --project=. ./example/FOLDER/SCRIPT.jl`. However, the reproduction of those degraded results requires additional modification. For example, you need to replace `include("boundary/boundary.jl")` in `/src/KitAMR.jl` with `include("boundary/boundary_noncvc.jl")` and type `]precompile` in the `REPL` of Julia to reproduce the result without cut-cell in velocity space displayed in `Figure 12`. If everything goes well, the solver will output a result folder containing a subfolder named `vtk`. You may read the result in it with the software such as [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org) for the visualization. To obtain the curve of the boundary quantities, you may refer to the example in `/example/r2v.jl`. The script will output a file named `NAME_1.csv` (_1 indicates the id of the immersed boundary, which is designed for the simulation with muti-ib) containing the coordinates, normal, and boundary quantities.
